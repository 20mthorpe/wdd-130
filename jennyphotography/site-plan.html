      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My older sister owns a photography and videography business. She is fairly successful using only her social medias as advertisement however, I believe she would be much more successful with a website because people could visit it to learn more about her business and how to book with her as well as see examples of her work. Isnâ€™t it an expectation nowadays for all businesses to have a website, especially photographers who need to display their work? I believe I could build a website to help her business flourish even more than it already does.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience for this website is anyone looking to book with a photographer. Most likely women, and they might be looking to book a wedding photographer or a photographer for family pictures. It could also be anyone wanting senior pictures.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->
