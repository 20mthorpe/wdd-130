        <h2>Mary Thorpe</h2>
        <p>I'm a software engineering major. I love BYU-Idaho because of the people and the classes.</p>
        <p>I just finished my mission a few weeks ago and this is my first semester back at school.
            I served in the Alabama Birmingham Mission, spanish speaking.</p>
        <p>The picture is of me and my older sister Jenny. I have a family of four 
            so it's just me and her and my parents (and our dog:). They all live in Utah, and my 
            sister is currently attending UVU.</p>
        <p>I like to play tennis and pickleball.</p>
